<Title> My name is Wendel!</Title>
This is my first website and I have no idea what I'm doing but I will somehow manage!
 <br>
Just give me a little bit of time and I will surely be able to figure it out. 
 <br>
A little information about me:
 <br>
I was born in the Philippines and I moved to the states at the age of 7. 
 <br>
The Philippines is a poor country, therefore we didn't have proper plumbing, stable roads, or even electricity sometimes.
 <br>
I can keep babbling about the Philippines but I doubt you'd want to hear about it!
 <br>
The only thing I want you to know about the Philippines is that the beaches there are ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!
